History of App Development
---------------------------------------------------
React native & Flutter are example of native like
1. Xamarin - Microsoft written c# iOS Android app in the same code . It written in c# convert & compile to native languages
2. React Native - native views can be accessed. Js + react library. Facebook developed 
3. Flutter - recent developed by Google 

Native Apps
Cons for native apps development =  2 dedicated team for android & IOS apps development = 2 team , 2 times salary , High Cost , High Time Consumption.
4 languages under native apps , IOS - Objective c + Swift , Android - Java + Kotlin
Pros are Performance + Security

Solution to Cons of Native Apps
Cordova = took web as a solution using html , css , js
Cons = shipping web view inside an app + Performance is not upto a native apps 
Pros = It solve one code all platform 
UI wise = android & IOS are having different UI = Hard to stick to one UI in web Apps

Final Solution to Native + web apps
Hybrid/Native Like apps = React native or Flutter 
Combination of native [performance & security ] + Web Apps [1 code = all platforms] -> Develop Apps 

---------------------------------------------------
Why React Native ?
---------------------------------------------------
React native can be written with Swift or Java to build react native apps
Flutter vs react native - WHY RN?
3 main reason
- big community, enough documentation, enough solutions to issues.
- Big companies using it , used by Facebook , uber eats , skype , Shopify 
- job wise more hiring
- cross platform iOS & Android

React native app: 
1. React native docs

Principle of react native code
Core components & native components
Compile react native code to native code
UI user interface are views (list button image)

Example <view> <Text> - react native
Android view - viewGroup , Textvie
iOS - UiTextview , UIView

React native gives 2 things - components & API 
Dimensions api gives user dimension using the external api

React library also used in native.
React library knows what to show in UI

Export is mandatory to use this code in other component

4 things to do code in react:
1. Import tools we need
2. Own components create
3. Fun things , style sheet is an api react gives us
4. Export - use it other components

Companies using react native to build their apps like Facebook , instagram , Uber Eats , Skype , Discord


------------------------------
React native apps prerequisites
------------------------------
1. lts nodejs
2. Vs code
3. Expo command line interface
4. React native app
5. Android stimulator
6. iPhone stimulator

 
------------------------------
RN Libraries
-------------------------------
React navigation / navigate to many pages
Firebase / authentication functionality
Stripe / Razorpay alternative
Paypal / Global payment
Google map / API to integrate maps inside apps
Css in JS 
Animate / Lote , Airbnb library
Deploy APPS
React Hooks 
Device Permission
Debugging Support

25$ One time payment for play store my Apps.



Developed by Meta in 2015 | Big Community | Meta so JSX + react based | Opening and demand is high | Cross platform support | Learning curve is low.

Start the APP development Learning by January 1st 2024.

sudo install -y , y means [automatically agree to install prompts that ask you to answer yes]

Homebrew
make --version // sudo apt install build-essential
curl - sudo apt install curl // curl --version
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

node --version && java --version -> mandate

git --version // sudo apt install git

brew update && upgrade
brew search htop // brew install htop

nano ~/.bashrc -> Export 3 line copy from docs paste it in the last line.
source ~/.bashrc


















React Native History
IoS , Android are 2 major mobile OS in current trend
We can't use Android apps in IOS Device and IOS apps in Android Phones
Initially apps in IOS is build in Objective C , because Apple OS build on Objective C & C 
2014 swift language was launched by apple to upgrade its objective c language for IOS apps development
Android was built by Google with java , so conversely Android apps are made by java
2010 Kotlin language has been launched by Jetbrains to develop android apps





Flutter

Google = Developed = 2017
Dart

4 Things to always do in react & React Native
Import dependent tools
Own components
Style sheets Fun
Export to use it [mandate]

React Native Gives
API
Components UI
React libraries also used in react native
React native code -> convert -> Native code

APP Development History
—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Built any mobile apps in iOS and Android
Microsoft Facebook Walmart using react native to build app
To build react native application you must know react first


History of React native
iOS , Android two major OS in the world
We can't use Android app in IOS same as in reverse

Apple app - objective C to use build iPhone app
Google app - Java to use build

iOS is written in objective C & C
Android is written in Java

New language created by iOS is Swift 
Kotlin language created by Android to build apps

2 languages to build Android & iOS apps respectively 

This 4 language comes under native way of creating an app, which means phone intend to develop an app

Companies want to spend too much money on having separate teams to develop Android & iOS apps . It's too costly

First solution came as web , cordova & ionic build apps in javascript, html , css looks like an app.
Problem with web apps is you literally ship a web view inside an app to view. 

But Apple & Android have different looks in apps. We should settle for one look in webapps & it's also slow.
Webapps never create serious apps.

PWA - progressive web apps . Progressiveapp.store
A website that you can download , or use on the web like Instagram , Google maps . But lacks in performance

Native like is like combining ideas of native & web . Native performance & web idea of same code used in both operating system
